This project automatically generates plain-English policy briefs from real unemployment data using R, Quarto, and Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes data analysis, visualizations, and AI-powered policy implications, all in a fully reproducible workflow.  

Note: To run the project, you need an OpenAI API key. Store it in your `.Renviron` file or set it in R using `Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here")`. The API key is required to generate the LLM summaries.
